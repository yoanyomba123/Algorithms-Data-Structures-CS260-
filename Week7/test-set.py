 Importing set.py should provide the following functions:

    set.Initialize(Values)       -- return a new set system with one element
                                    per set.

                                    Values is a list of values for the
                                    sets

    set.Find(set, value)         -- Return the name of the set in which value lives.
                                    Do path compression.

                                    Exactly what you return isn't
                                    important, as long as Find(set,
                                    val1) and Find(set, val2) are
                                    equal if and only if val1 and val2
                                    are in the same set.

    set.Merge(set, value1, value2)  -- Merge operation.  Make sure you parent
                                       the smaller set to the larger.
